# Identification of Parkinson's Disease Biomarkers using Machine Learning
This project aims to identify robust transcriptomic biomarkers for the early detection of Parkinson's Disease (PD) using a consensus-based machine learning approach. By integrating univariate statistical analysis with multiple classification algorithms (Logistic Regression, Support Vector Machines, and Random Forest), we isolate a consistent gene signature capable of distinguishing PD patients from healthy controls.

The study leverages high-dimensional gene expression data to filter out method-specific artifacts, resulting in a validated set of biomarkers (including *CEACAM4*, *IFI27*, and *ITCH*) that are biologically relevant to neurodegenerative pathways such as steroid biosynthesis and mitochondrial dysfunction.
